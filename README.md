# Facial Emotion Detector
	•	A real-time web application that detects facial emotions using AI and provides instant feedback through text labels.
	•	Built using ReactJS and face-api.js.
	•	face-api.js is a JavaScript API for face detection and facial expression recognition in the browser, implemented on top of the TensorFlow.js core API.

## About This Project
The objective of this project is to demonstrate real-time emotion recognition directly in the browser using your webcam.

Once the app detects your face, it will:

	•	Classify the expression into one of seven emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Disgusted, Surprised, and Neutral.

	•	Provide instant feedback through clear text output.

All detection and processing are powered by face-api.js, which runs locally in your browser without sending any data to a server.
You can read more about face-api.js here.

## Note: You are not being recorded at any point. All computations happen inside your browser.

## Features
	•	Real-time facial emotion detection
	•	Seven emotion classifications
	•	Text-based feedback
